# Repo Overview

This repository demonstrates how to secure a RAG-based AI Agent using an enterprise, Security-as-Code approach:

- Design-time STRIDE threat modeling
- Pre-deployment CI/CD security gates with drift signals and adversarial testing
- Runtime evaluation and guardrails using Galileo-style measurement (hallucination + PII thresholds)
- Evidence-first CI outputs uploaded automatically as GitHub Actions artifacts
